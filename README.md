# sandpiles
     
Implementation of the [Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) sandpiles model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model).
This was the first discovered dynamical system that showed criticality without the fine tuning of any of its parameters.
This property is called [self-organized criticality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organized_criticality).

This python module allows to create, analyse and visualize lattices following this model.


## Output examples

Period 2 limit cycle in a 20x20 lattice with periodic boundary conditions.
